\label{map} \index{Map object}

The purpose of {\em map objects} is to provide functionality for
handling and storing geographical maps. In addition, {\em map
objects} serve as auxiliary objects for regression models with
spatial effects, where the effect of a location variable is to be
included via a spatially correlated prior. In this context, {\em
map objects} store the neighborhood structure of a map and provide
functionality to compute weights associated with this neighborhood
structure.

The typical approach will be as follows: A {\em map object} is
created, the boundary information of a geographical map is read
from an external file and stored in the {\em map object}. This can
be achieved using the #infile# command, see \autoref{mapinfile}
below. Based on the boundary information, the {\em map object}
automatically computes the neighborhood structure of the map and
the weights associated with the neighborhood structure. Since
there are several proposals in the spatial statistics literature
for defining weights, the user is given the choice between a
couple of alternatives. Afterwards the {\em map object} can be
passed to the #regress# function of a regression object to
estimate regression models with spatial covariates, see
\autoref{bayesreg} and \autoref{remlreg}, and in particular the
subsections about spatial covariates therein.

\subsection{Description}


Method #infile# is used to read the boundary information of a
geographical map stored in an external file. Currently, two file
formats are supported: {\em boundary files} and {\em graph files}.
A {\em boundary file} contains information about the boundaries of
the different regions of a map in terms of closed polygons, i.e.
the boundary of each region is represented by a set of connected
straight lines. A detailed description of the structure of
boundary files is given below.

A {\em graph file} stores the nodes and edges of a graph
representing the neighborhood structure of a map. In addition,
weights associated with the edges of the graph can be specified.
In terms of geographical maps, the nodes of the graph correspond
to the regions of the map while the edges specify the neighborhood
structure. As a consequence, the neighborhood structure of a
geographical map is immediately available in a {\em graph file}
while it has to be computed from the polygons in case of a {\em
boundary file} (a task which may be time-consuming). Therefore an
advisable strategy is to read a {\em boundary files} only once to
compute the neighborhood structure and to store it as a {\em graph
file} afterwards (using the #outfile# command, see
\autoref{mapoutfile}). This is particularly the case for
geographical maps with a lot of regions. However, using {\em graph
files} also has a disadvantage: Visualization of geographical
information is only possible with boundary files since only these
contain the information on the boundaries required for visual
representation.

\subsection{Syntax}

#> #{\em objectname}.#infile# [{\em , options}] #using# {\em filename}

Method #infile# reads the map information stored in the {\em
boundary} or {\em graph file} {\em filename}. If option #graph# is
specified, {\em BayesX} expects a {\em graph file}, otherwise a
{\em boundary file} is expected.

\subsubsection*{Structure of a boundary file}

A {\em boundary file} provides the boundary information of a
geographical map in terms of closed polygons. For each region of
the map, the boundary files contains a block of lines defining the
name of the region, the number of lines the polygon consists of,
and the polygons themselves. The first line of such a block
contains the region code surrounded by quotation marks and the
number of lines the polygon of the region consists of. The region
code and the number of lines must be separated by a comma. The
subsequent lines contain the coordinates of the straight lines
that form the boundary of the region. The straight lines are
represented by the coordinates of their end points. Coordinates
must be separated by a comma.

To give an example we print a (small) part of the {\em boundary
file} of Germany:

The  map corresponding to this part of the {\em boundary file} can
be found in \autoref{partgermany}. Note that the first and the
last point of a polygon must be identical (see the example above)
to obtain a closed polygon.

\includegraphics [scale=0.3]{grafiken/westpart.eps}
{\em\caption{\label{partgermany} Corresponding graph of the
section of the boundary file}}
\end{figure}

In some cases a region may be divided into a number of subregions
that are not connected. As an example, \autoref{westsub} shows a
region within Germany that is separated into 8 subregions. In such
a case each subregion has to be included separately in the {\em
boundary file} but all subregions should share the same region
code. Note that the subregions can be placed anywhere in the {\em
boundary file} and, in particular, do not have to follow each
other.

Another special case that requires additional attention is
illustrated in \autoref{westin}: A region is completely surrounded
by another region. In this case an additional line has to be added
to the boundary description of the {\em surrounded} region. This
additional line is placed between the first line and the polygons
and has to contain the region code of the {\em surrounding}
region. The full syntax is:

#is.in#,"{\em region code}"

The following lines show a section of the {\em boundary file} of
Germany, where region "9361" is totally
surrounded by region "9371":

\footnotesize

\hspace{1cm} $\vdots$

"9361",7 \\

\end{figure}

Finally, we want to draw attention to an important limitation of
the current version of {\em BayesX}. In most cases {\em map
objects} serve as auxiliary objects to estimate spatial effects
with {\em bayesreg objects} or {\em remlreg objects}. In this case
the names of the regions of the map and the values of the
corresponding spatial covariate have to match. Since only
numerical variables allowed in {\em dataset objects}, the names of
the regions in the {\em map object} have to be numbers, although,
in principle, there is no limitation for the names of regions in
{\em map objects}.

\subsubsection*{Structure of a graph file}

A graph file stores the nodes and the edges of a graph $G =
(N,E)$, see for example George and Liu (1981, Ch. 3) for a brief
introduction to graph theory. A graph is a convenient way to
represent the neighborhood structure of a geographical map, where
the nodes of the graph correspond to the region codes while the
neighborhood structure is represented by the edges of the graph.
In some situations it can be useful to define weights associated
with the edges of a graph which can be stored in the {\em graph
file} as well.

In {\em BayesX}, the first line of a {\em graph file} has to
contain the total number of nodes of the graph. Afterwards, each
region (or node) is represented by a block of three lines. The
first of these lines contains the name of the node (typically the
name of the geographical region). The second line states the
number of edges for that particular node. The third line contains
the corresponding edges of the node, represented by the index of a
neighboring node. Note that the index starts with zero, i.e. the
first node is represented by the index 0, the second node by the
index 1, and so on.

We illustrate the structure of a {\em graph file} with an example. The
following few lines are the beginning
of the {\em graph file} corresponding to the map of (former) West Germany:

\footnotesize

327 \\
9162 \\
3 \\
1 2 3 \\
9174 \\
6 \\
0 4 2 3 5 6 \\
9179 \\
6 \\
0 1 7 3 8 6

\hspace{1cm} $\vdots$

\normalsize

\vspace{0.5cm}

The first line specifies the total number of nodes, 327 in the
present example. The subsequent three lines correspond to the node
with name '9162', which is the first region in the map of West
Germany. Region '9162' has 3 neighbors, namely the second, third
and fourth node appearing in the graph file. Once again, note that
the index starts with zero, i.e. 0 corresponds to the first node,
1 corresponds to the second node and so on. Lines 5 to 7 in the
example correspond to node '9174' and its neighbors and lines 8 to
10 correspond to node '9179'.

{\em Graph files} also allow to specify weights associated with
the edges of the nodes. Since no weights have been explicitly
specified in the preceding example, all weights are automatically
defined to be equal to one. Nonequal weights can specified in the
{\em graph file} by adding them following the edges of a
particular node. An example of the beginning of a {\em graph file}
with weights is given below:

\footnotesize

327 \\
9162 \\
3 \\
1 2 3 0.4 1.2 0.7\\
9174 \\
6 \\
0 4 2 3 5 6 0.4 0.3 0.8 0.8 1.4 1.6\\
9179 \\
6 \\
0 1 7 3 8 6 1.2 0.8 0.2 1.8 1.7 1.3

\hspace{1cm} $\vdots$

\normalsize

\vspace{0.5cm}

In this case, the edges of the first node '9162' have weights 0.4,
1.2 and 0.7.\bigskip


\subheader{Options}

\begin{itemize}
\item #graph# \\
If #graph# is specified as an additional option, {\em BayesX}
expects a {\em graph file} rather than a {\em boundary file}.
\item #weightdef=adjacency# $|$ #centroid#  $|$ #combnd# \\
\label{weightsmap} Option #weightdef# allows to request the
computation of weights associated with each pair of neighbors.
Currently there are three weight specifications available:
#weightdef=adjacency#, #weightdef=centroid# and
#weightdef=combnd#. For #weightdef=adjacency# all weights are set
equal to one. This is the most common choice in spatial statistics
and also the default weight method.

Specifying #weightdef=centroid# results in weights which are
inverse proportional to the distance of the centroids of
neighboring regions. More specifically, the weight $w_{us}$ of two
neighboring regions $u$ and $s$ is set to $w_{us} = c \cdot
\exp(-d(u,s))$, where $d$ is the Euclidian distance between the
centroids of the two sites and $c$ is a normalizing constant. In
analogy to adjacency weights, the constant $c$ is chosen in such a
way that the total sum of weights is equal to the total number of
neighbors.

The third choice #weightdef=combnd# results in weights
proportional to the length of the common boundary of two regions.
Similarly to #weightdef=centroid#, the weights are normalized,
i.e. the total sum of weights is equal to the number of neighbors.

Note that the specification of the #weightdef# option is only
meaningful if a {\em boundary file} is read. For {\em graph files}
the option has no effect since the boundary information of regions
is missing and the computation of weights is therefore not
possible.

\begin{stanza}{Description}

Method #outfile# performs the reverse of the #infile# command,
i.e. the current map information is written to an external file.
The map information can be written either in {\em boundary file}
or in {\em graph file} format.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}{Syntax}

#># {\em objectname}.#outfile# [{\em , options}] #using# {\em
filename}

#outfile# writes the map information to the external file
specified in {\em filename}. If #graph# is specified as an
additional option, the file format will be a {\em graph file} and
a {\em boundary file} otherwise.
\end{stanza}

\subheader{Options}

\begin{itemize}
\item #graph# \\
Forces the program to store the map information in {\em graph
file} format rather than in {\em boundary file} format.
\item #includeweights# \\
Option #includeweights# is meaningful only if the storing format
is a {\em graph file}, i.e. if option #graph# is specified. In
this case, the weights associated with the edges (neighbors) of
the nodes (regions) are stored in addition to the graph structure.
\item #replace# \\
The #replace# option allows {\em BayesX} to overwrite an already
existing file. If #replace# is omitted in the optionlist an error
will be raised if you attempt to overwrite an existing file. This
prevents you from overwriting an existing file unintentionally.
