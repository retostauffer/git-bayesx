<p style="font-weight:bold">General scope</p>

<p>BayesX is a software tool for estimating structured additive regression models. Structured additive regression 
embraces several well-known regression models such as generalized additive models (GAM), generalized additive mixed models (GAMM), 
generalized geoadditive mixed models (GGAMM), dynamic models, varying coefficient models (VCM), and geographically weighted regression
within a unifying framework. Besides exponential family regression, BayesX also supports non-standard regression situations 
such as regression for categorical responses, hazard regression for continuous survival times, and continuous time
multi-state models (see model classes and model terms below).</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Inferential procedures</p>

<p>Estimation of regression models can be achieved based on two different inferential concepts: 
Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques corresponding to full Bayesian inference
and mixed model methodology corresponding to penalised likelihood or empirical Bayes inference. 
Both concepts have been implemented in separate regression objects:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>MCMC simulation techniques (bayesreg objects).</b><br>
A fully Bayesian interpretation of structured additive regression models is obtained by specifying
prior distributions for all unknown parameters. Estimation can be facilitated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation 
techniques, a general and versatile concept for Bayesian inference. Bayesreg objects provide numerically efficient
implementations of MCMC schemes for structured additive regression models. Suitable proposal densities have been developed to
obtain rapidly mixing, well-behaved sampling schemes without the need for manual tuning.</li>

<li><b>Mixed model based estimation (remlreg objects).</b><br>
An increasingly popular way to estimate semiparametric regression models is the representation of
penalisation approaches as mixed models. Within BayesX this concept has been extended to structured additive regression models
and several types of non-standard regression situations. The general idea is to take advantage of the close connection
between penalty concepts and corresponding random effects distributions. The smoothing parameters of the penalties then transform
to variance components in the random effects (mixed) model. While the selection of smoothing parameters has been a difficult task for
a long time, several estimation procedures for variance components in mixed models are already available since the 1970's.
The most popular one is restricted maximum likelihood in Gaussian mixed models with marginal likelihood as the non-Gaussian counterpart.<br>
Remlreg objects employ mixed model methodology for the estimation of structured additive regression models.
While regression coefficients are estimated based on penalised likelihood, restricted maximum likelihood or marginal likelihood
estimation forms the basis for the determination of smoothing parameters. From a Bayesian perspective, this yields 
empirical Bayes / posterior mode estimates for the structured additive regression models. However, estimates can also merely
be interpreted as penalised likelihood estimates from a frequentist perspective.
</li>
<li><b>Penalized least squares including model selection (stepwisereg objects).</b><br>
As a third alternative, BayesX provides a penalized least squares (respectively penalized likelihood) approach for
estimating structured additive regression tools. In addition to
the previously described estimation alternatives a powerful variable and model selection tool is included.  Model choice and estimation of
the parameters is done simultaneously. The algorithms are able to
<ul>
<li>decide whether a particular covariate enters the model,</li>
<li>decide whether a continuous covariate enters the model linearly or nonlinearly,</li>
<li>decide whether a spatial effect enters the model,</li>
<li>decide whether a unit- or cluster specific heterogeneity effect enters the model,</li>
<li>select complex interaction effects (two dimensional surfaces, varying coefficient terms),</li>
<li>select the degree of smoothness of  nonlinear covariate, spatial or cluster specific heterogeneity effects.</li>
</ul>
Inference is based on penalized likelihood in combination with fast
algorithms for selecting relevant covariates and model terms.
Different models are compared via various goodness of fit criteria,
e.g. AIC, BIC, GCV and 5 or 10 fold cross validation.
</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Model classes and model terms</p>

<p>BayesX provides functionality for the following types of responses:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Univariate exponential family</b><br>
Supported response distributions are Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial, Gamma, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial.
</li>
<li><b>Categorical responses with unordered responses</b><br>
For categorical responses with unordered categories, BayesX supports multinomial logit and multinomial probit models.
Both effects of category-specific and globally-defined covariates can be estimated. Category-specific offsets or 
non-availability indicators can be defined to account for varying availability and varying choice sets.
</li>
<li><b>Categorical responses with ordered responses</b><br>
For ordered categorical responses, ordinal as well as sequential models can be specified. 
Effects can be requested to be category-specific or to be constant over the categories. Supported response functions include
the logit and the probit transformation.
</li>
<li><b>Continuous time survival models</b><br>
BayesX supports Cox-type hazard regression models with structured additive predictor for continuous time survival analysis. 
In contrast to the Cox model, the baseline hazard rate is estimated jointly with the remaining effects based on penalized splines.
Furthermore, both time-varying effects and time-varying covariates can be included in the predictor. Arbitrary combinations of
right, left and interval censored as well as left truncated obserations can be analysed. 
</li>
<li><b>Continuous time multi-state models</b><br>
Multi-state models form a general class for the analysis of the evolution of discrete phenomena in continuous time. 
Transition intensities between the discrete states are specified in analogy to the hazard rate in continuous time survival models.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Structured additive regression models can be build from arbitrary combinations of the following model terms:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Nonlinear effects:</b><br>
Nonlinear effects can be estimated based on either penalised spline or random walk models.</li>
<li><b>Seasonal effects:</b><br>
Specific autoregressive priors allow for the estimation of flexible, time-varying seasonal effects.
</li>
<li><b>Spatial effects:</b><br>
Spatial effects can be specified based on Markov random fields, stationary Gaussian random fields (kriging) or
bivariate penalised splines. Both georeferenced regional data as well as point-referenced data based on coordinates 
are  supported.
</li>
<li><b>Interaction surfaces:</b><br>
Bivariate extensions of penalised splines allow to estimate flexible interactions between continuous covariates.
Stationary Gaussian random fields can also be considered a radial basis function approach and, hence, form a second
possibility for the specification of interaction surfaces.
</li>
<li><b>Varying coefficients:</b><br>
Varying coefficient models with both continuous and spatial effect modifiers can be estimated. The latter case is also 
known as geograhpcially weighted regression.
</li>
<li><b>Cluster-specific random effects:</b><br>
BayesX supports i.i.d. Gaussian random intercepts and random slopes.
</li>
<li><b>Regularised high-dimensional effects:</b><br>
High-dimensional vectors of regression coefficients can be assigned Bayesian regularisation priors. Available alternatives are ridge
regression, lasso regularisation and normal mixture of inverse gamma (spike and slab) priors.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that parts of the functionality may be available for one of the regression objects only. For example, 
bayesreg objects do not support interval censored survival times while multinomial probit models can not be estimated with
remlreg objects. Details can be found in the reference manual.</p>


<p style="font-weight:bold">Further functionality</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Handling and manipulation of data sets.</b><br>
BayesX provides a growing number of functions for handling and manipulating data sets, e.g.
for reading ASCII data sets, creating new variables, obtaining summary statistics etc.</li>
<li><b>Handling and manipulation of geographical maps.</b><br>
BayesX is able to manipulate and draw geographical maps.  The regions of the map may be colored
according to some numerical characteristics. In Bayesx version 1.5, a new color scheme based on HCL colors has been added to obtain 
a better representation of colored maps independent of the display device.</li>
<li><b>Visualizing data.</b><br>
BayesX provides functions for drawing scatter plots and geographical maps.
A number of additional options are provided to customize the graphs according to
the personal needs of the user.</li>
<li><b>R Package BayesX</b><br>
In addition to BayesX, there is an R add-on package of the same name that provides additional functionality for manipulating geographical data 
and additional graphics facilities. In particular, the package includes resources for constructing boundary and graph files from other geographical
information systems.
</li>
<li><b>Model selection for Gaussian and non-Gaussian dags.</b><br>
This tool estimates Gaussian and non-Gaussian directed acyclical graphs (dag) via reversible jump MCMC.
</li>
</ul>
